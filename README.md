## About Cisco Packet Tracer
Packet Tracer is a tool which used to implement the knowledge of networking that we have gained and to prepare some popular exams like CCNA. This is a virtual environment that intimate a live Networking Simulation.

#about this Project
In this networking design, there will be three main counters. The following arrangements will be there in all the three counters
1) Regional Branch
1. There will be three main cabins inside each counter and these will be interconnected.
2. It is mandatory to have a reception center in each counter and all these reception centers should be interconnected.
3. Each counter will have deposit, withdrawal, registration cabins which will be interconnected.
4. Each counter will have Regional branch manager's cabin which will be interconnected. 
 I have been using the following topic:-

STATIC FLOATING ROUTING
VOIP CONFIGRATION AND VOIP DIAL PEERING 
ROUTER INFORMATION PROTOCOL
INTERVLAN ROUTING 
VTP (VLAN TRUNKING PROTOCOL )
ROAS (ROUTER ON A STICK)
OSPF SINGLE AREA 
GENERIC ROUTING ENCAPSUlATION
PORT SECURITY CONFIGRATION 

 2) Head Branch
This network design will have three counters which will be interconnected.
Each counter will have enquiry office which will be interconnected.
Each counter will have registration center which will be interconnected.
Each counter will have bank manager cabin which will be interconnected.
Each counter will have other service cabin which will be interconnected.
Each counter should have deposit ,withdrawal ,documentation center which will be interconnected.
Each counter will have three head offices which will be interconnected.
 I have been using the following topic:-

OSPF MULTI AREA
DEFAULT FLOATING ROUTING 
POINT TO POINT PPP AND Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)  
BORDER GATEWAY PROTOCOL 
STATIC ROUTING PROTOCOL
PORT SECURITY VIOLATION
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol 
SWITCH VIRTUAL GATEWAY 
OSPF SINGLE AREA 
 PORT SECURITY VIOLATION

3) Sub Branch Site (IPv6 ADDRESS)
1. Each counter will have three cabins which will be interconnected.
2. Each counter must have a reception center and all these reception centers should be interconnected.
3. Each counter will have deposit, withdrawal, registration cabins which will be interconnected.
4. Each counter will have Sub Branch Manager cabin which will be interconnected.
 5. Each counter will have a registration centre which will be interconnected.
 I have been using the following topic:-
IPv6 STATIC ROUTING
IPv6 DEFAULT ROUTING
IPv6 Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol  
IPv6 OSPF ROUTING
IPv6 ROUTER INFORMATION ROUTING
PORT SECURITY VIOLATION

4) Security and Administration
1. IP will be provided to all devices from the admin server.
2. Admin servers will be interlinked with their sub admin device and SSH configuration facility will be provided in them.
3. System devices will be connected to the system server. System server and system devices resources will not be made available to other systems.
4. Main side and sub side should be interconnected.
5. With the help of wireless local area network controller, IP will be allocated to all wireless devices and security will be provided.
I have been using the following topic:-
RELAY AGENT CONFIGRATION
DHCP ASA  CONFIGRATION
BASIC INSPECTION CONFIGRATION
ASA HSRP (Hot Standby Routing Protocol) 
WIRELESS LAN CONTROLLER 
PORT SECURITY VIOLATION
